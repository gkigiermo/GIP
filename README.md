# GIP

The Generic Integration Platform (GIP) is a proof of concept of my proposal to develop computational fluid dynamics(CFD) codes efficiently and highly portable.
The main idea consists of reinterpreting the stencil-based operations as purely algebraic kernels. A special treatment is proposed for the non-linear operators to convert them into a concatenation of linear operators.
